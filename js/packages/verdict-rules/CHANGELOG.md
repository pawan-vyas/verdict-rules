[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), scoped to this package — it
releases independently of the other language SDKs and of the AI-agent skill.

## 0.0.1

Initial publish.

- `Rule` (a structural `interface`), `FunctionRule`, `AndRule`, `OrRule`,
  `RulesEngine`, `RuleResult`, `RunResult`.
- Sequential, never concurrent evaluation, so short-circuiting is a real
  contract rather than a best-effort optimisation.
- Vacuous-truth polarity decided per composite: `AndRule([])` passes,
  `OrRule([])` fails.
- Unknown rule names and unknown groups throw rather than returning a vacuous
  pass — emptiness folds to an identity, absence is an error.
- `RulesEngine.tryRunNamed` / `tryRunGroup`, returning `undefined` rather than
  throwing when nothing matches — the primitives the throwing forms are built
  on. `undefined` means absent, never failed.
- `RulesEngine.ruleNames` / `groupNames` for enumerating an engine.
- `UnknownLookupError`, carrying `kind` and `key`, so an unknown lookup is
  catchable by type rather than by matching message text.
- Ships as ESM, CommonJS, and an ES2019 global bundle for a plain `<script>`
  tag or a CDN URL. Node 18+, zero runtime dependencies, types included.
